Went\n\n\nIn life, he was a safflower,\nyou always showered on it,\nwhen it dried up, it dried up,\nlook at Madhuvan's chest,\nhow dry its buds\nwithered, how many flowers\nthat withered, where did they bloom again, but tell me , when Madhuvan makes noise\non dry flowers, what has passed is gone.\n\n\nIn life there was a cup of honey,\nyou had given your body and mind to it,\nwhen it broke, it broke down\nin the courtyard of the tavern, see\nhow many cups get shaken,\nfall and get mixed with the soil,\nwhen they get up when they fall,\nbut tell me\nwhen the tavern regrets\nthe past gone is gone\n\nThey are made of soft clay, they keep\nbreaking the honey pots, they\nhave brought a short life, they\nkeep breaking the cups,\nyet there\nis a shortage of honey in the taverns, the honey cups,\nthose who are intoxicated,\nthey keep looting the honey,\nhe is a raw drinker.\nWhose love is on cups,\nwho burns with true honey,\nwhen does he cry, shouts,\nwhat has passed is gone.",
